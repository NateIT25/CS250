How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with meeting stakeholders and gathering all the necessary details to build the right software solution. User stories are a valuable tool in this process because they capture exactly what the user requires, helping ensure the product is relevant and effective. They are vital because they provide precise insights from the end user, ensuring the final product meets the needs of not only the stakeholders but also all users who will interact with it.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs begins with gathering data, listening to stakeholders, and writing user stories. These tools help prioritize tasks and shape a clear vision of what stakeholders want. One Agile practice I hope to incorporate in my future development work is daily stand-ups, as they are an excellent way to ensure all ideas are heard and important information is shared efficiently.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development communicates clearly, is reliable, and remains open to feedback. Being a strong collaborator means keeping an open mind, understanding different perspectives, and learning from one another to ensure the final product is of the highest quality.
